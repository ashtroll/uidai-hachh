    "# UIDAI Aadhaar Analytics: Understanding Patterns and Driving Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hackathon Submission**  \n",
    "**Focus:** Discover meaningful patterns and trends in Aadhaar data to help make smarter decisions about system improvements  \n",
    "**Data Period:** March 2 – December 31, 2025 (304 days)  \n",
    "**Total Data Points:** 5.4 million enrolments | 119 million demographic updates | 70 million biometric updates\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is designed as a **decision-support tool** for UIDAI leadership. In particular, it aims to provide a quantitative framework to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide how to **allocate a finite number of new enrolment kits / mobile vans** across states and districts\n",
    "- Prioritise a **budget for targeted adult-enrolment campaigns** in the specific regions where the gap is largest\n",
    "- Identify locations where **data quality or system issues** may require immediate intervention before scaling programmes\n",
    "\n",
    "All metrics, findings and visualisations are structured to support these concrete choices rather than abstract description.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Summary of Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis looks at how Aadhaar enrolments and updates work across India. Here are the main discoveries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Most activity is concentrated in just 5 states** – They account for more than half of all enrolments. This creates uneven workload across centres.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Young people are being enrolled much more than adults** – 51% are children under 17, while less than 2.5% are adults. This may leave working-age migrants unregistered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **People actively use Aadhaar after enrolling** – On average, there are 21.9 updates per person, which shows the system is being used regularly for important services.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Some regions show data quality issues** – Very small territories show unusually high update numbers compared to their enrolment size, which suggests possible problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Demand follows a predictable pattern** – Daily enrolments vary widely, but follow weekly and monthly patterns that we can forecast and plan for.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Migration is a major driver** – Northern states show lots of demographic changes, indicating people frequently move and update their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **We can predict future demand much better** – Current simple forecasting is weak, but more sophisticated models can improve accuracy significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are organised along four lenses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fairness and Inclusion** – who is being enrolled, and where\n",
    "- **System Health and Anomalies** – where numbers look implausible or unstable\n",
    "- **Usage Intensity** – how heavily Aadhaar is relied upon after enrolment\n",
    "- **Demand Forecasting** – how much capacity is needed, and when\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement and Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Are We Solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aadhaar is India's identity system that serves over 1.4 billion people across 55 states and territories, and 983 districts. To make it work better, we need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Who gets enrolled?** Are all communities and regions being reached fairly?\n",
    "- **How is the system being used?** Do people keep their information current?\n",
    "- **Where are the bottlenecks?** Which areas don't have enough capacity?\n",
    "- **Can we predict what will happen next?** Can we forecast demand to avoid long queues or unused resources?\n",
    "- **Are there problems we haven't noticed?** Can we spot data quality issues or fraud early?\n",
    "\n",
    "We frame these questions as inputs to specific decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where should UIDAI **deploy the next wave of enrolment kits and mobile vans**?\n",
    "- Which states and districts should be **first in line for adult-enrolment drives**?\n",
    "- Where do we need **data audits or system checks** before scaling further?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at Aadhaar data through four different angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "| What We Looked At | Key Questions | What We Measured |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Fairness and Inclusion** | Are all regions and age groups being reached equally? | How enrolments are spread across states and age groups |\n",
    "| **System Health** | Are there unusual patterns or quality problems? | Unexpected spikes, duplicate records, unusual numbers |\n",
    "| **How People Use It** | How active are people in updating their information? | How many updates happen for each person |\n",
    "| **Demand Forecasting** | Can we predict busy and slow periods? | Patterns in daily enrolment numbers |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each set of metrics and charts is tied back to at least one of the three core decisions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Datasets Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset 1: Aadhaar Enrolment Records\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it contains:** Records of when and where people enrol for Aadhaar  \n",
    "**Time period:** March 2 to December 31, 2025 (10 months)  \n",
    "**Number of records:** 1,006,029  \n",
    "**Total enrolments:** 5,435,702 people\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns included:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name | What It Means | Example |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `date` | Date when enrolment happened | 2025-03-02 |\n",
    "| `state` | State or Union Territory | Uttar Pradesh |\n",
    "| `district` | District name | Kanpur Nagar |\n",
    "| `pincode` | 6-digit postal code | 208001 |\n",
    "| `age_0_5` | Number of children aged 0-5 enrolled | 29 |\n",
    "| `age_5_17` | Number of children aged 5-17 enrolled | 82 |\n",
    "| `age_18_greater` | Number of adults aged 18+ enrolled | 12 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** About 51% of all enrolments are children under 17 years old. This shows a strong focus on enrolling young people.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset 2: Demographic Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it contains:** Records of when people update their basic information (name, address, phone number, email)  \n",
    "**Time period:** March 1 to December 29, 2025  \n",
    "**Number of records:** 2,071,700  \n",
    "**Total updates:** 49,295,187 updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns included:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name | What It Means |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| `date` | Date when update happened |\n",
    "| `state` | State or Union Territory |\n",
    "| `district` | District name |\n",
    "| `pincode` | 6-digit postal code |\n",
    "| `demo_age_5_17` | Number of demographic updates for children aged 5-17 |\n",
    "| `demo_age_17_` | Number of demographic updates for people aged 17+ |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** On average, there are 9,067 demographic updates for every 1,000 people enrolled. This shows that people frequently change their addresses or contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset 3: Biometric Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it contains:** Records of when people get their fingerprints, iris scans, or photos re-captured  \n",
    "**Time period:** March 1 to December 29, 2025  \n",
    "**Number of records:** 1,861,108  \n",
    "**Total updates:** 69,763,095 updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns included:**\n",

    "| `bio_age_17_` | Number of biometric updates for people aged 17+ |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** There are 12,839 biometric updates for every 1,000 people enrolled. This is higher than demographic updates, likely because children's biometric features change as they grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Dataset: Population Benchmarks (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "State-level comparisons in this notebook are currently based on **raw enrolment volumes**. This is useful for capacity planning but can be misleading for performance comparisons, because large-population states are expected to have high volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more accurate view of performance and equity, we recommend enriching this analysis with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State-level population projections for 2025 (or latest available)**  \n",
    "- **District-level population estimates**, where available\n",
    "\n",
    "These would allow us to compute per-capita metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `enrolments_per_100k_pop = total_enrolments / population * 100,000`\n",
    "- `updates_per_100k_pop = total_updates / population * 100,000`\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the recommended advanced charts (for example, normalised state rankings and hotspot maps) are designed to plug directly into such a population table once it is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analysing, we checked the data for problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue Checked | What We Found | Severity | How We Fixed It |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Duplicate records** | Demographic data had 22.86% duplicates | Medium | We combined them by adding totals |\n",
    "| **Negative numbers** | None found – all counts were zero or positive | Low | No action needed |\n",
    "| **Missing dates** | No dates were missing | Low | No action needed |\n",
    "| **State name variations** | \"WESTBENGAL\" vs \"West Bengal\"; \"Daman & Diu\" vs \"Daman And Diu\" | Medium | We standardized all names to one format |\n",
    "| **Unusual numbers** | Island territories had impossible update-to-enrolment ratios (up to 4,514:1) | **Critical** | Flagged for immediate audit and pipeline review |\n",
    "| **Small sample sizes** | Island territories had fewer than 1,000 enrolments each | Medium | We noted that these results may not be reliable in percentages |\n",
    "\n",
    "The island-territory ratios are treated in this report as **high-priority anomalies** that merit dedicated follow-up (data pipeline checks, audit of local processes, and potential fraud investigation), not just a footnote.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed state names:** We created a list of common spelling variations and converted everything to a standard format\n",
    "   - Example: \"WESTBENGAL\", \"Westbengal\", \"West Bengal\" → \"West Bengal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Organized data by date:** We made sure all dates were in the correct format so we could track changes over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardized location names:** We converted state and district names to proper case (first letter capital)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fixed postal codes:** We ensured all postal codes were exactly 6 digits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouped data by location and date:** We added up all the enrolments and updates by state and day\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Created summary tables:** We built tables showing total enrolments and updates for each state across the entire 10-month period\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Created age group summaries:** We calculated what percentage of each state's enrolments were children vs adults\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Created comparison metrics:** We calculated how many updates happened per 1,000 enrolments in each region, so we could compare fairly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a metric we created:**\n",
    "- Demographic Update Rate = (Total Demographic Updates ÷ Total Enrolments) × 1,000\n",
    "- This shows how actively people in each region update their information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Pattern Detection (Anomaly Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked for days when enrolment numbers were much higher or lower than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial version of this analysis applied a **national 7-day rolling average**, which is useful to check that the overall system is not crashing, but is **too coarse to detect local anomalies** at the state or district level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust anomaly-detection approach, recommended for production use, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each **state** (and, where daily data is available, for each **district**):\n",
    "   - Sort daily enrolment counts by date\n",
    "   - Compute a 7-day rolling mean and standard deviation\n",
    "   - Calculate a z-score for each day\n",
    "2. Flag a day as an anomaly if its absolute z-score is above a chosen threshold (for example 2.5 or 3.0)\n",
    "3. Count anomalies per state/district and month, and prioritise follow-up where anomalies are frequent or extremely large\n",
    "\n",
    "At the current level of aggregation we do not see national-level anomalies, but the **island territories clearly qualify as critical anomalies** and are treated as such in the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Time-Series Analysis and Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculated a 7-day moving average** to smooth out daily ups and downs and see the true trend\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Looked for weekly patterns** – weekdays versus weekends\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Looked for monthly patterns** – spikes around the middle of the month, possibly due to government payments\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Built a simple baseline forecast from the moving average\n",
    "\n",
    "For more accurate capacity planning, we recommend (and provide example code for) using a **proper time-series model** such as Facebook Prophet, which can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capture **weekly and monthly seasonality** simultaneously\n",
    "- Incorporate known holiday effects\n",
    "- Provide estimates of future demand with quantified uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecasting section later in the notebook includes Prophet-ready code that can be activated once the library is installed in the environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "This view is **volume-based** and naturally dominated by the most populous states. It is useful for understanding total workload but does **not** tell us which administrations are over- or under-performing relative to their population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- 5 states are doing more than half the work, which could create delays and long queues\n",
    "- Smaller states might not have enough enrolment centres for their population\n",
    "- Some people might be left unregistered in underserved states\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done (volume view):**\n",
    "- Move more staff and resources to states with high demand\n",
    "- Build more centres in smaller states\n",
    "- Find out why some states have lower enrolments and help them catch up\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess **performance relative to population**, we also recommend a **population-normalised view** (enrolments per 100,000 population). This requires an external population file and is supported by the advanced helper functions defined earlier.\n",

    "| Children 5-17 years | 29% |\n",

    "\n",
    "| Region | Children 0-5 % | Children 5-17 % | Adults % | What It Shows |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Central India (MP, CG, Jharkhand) | 74-77% | 22-25% | <2% | Very strong focus on babies through schools |\n",
    "| Western India (MH, Gujarat, Goa, Rajasthan) | 75-86% | 14-22% | <2% | Highest infant focus; strong health programme link |\n",
    "| Eastern India (Bihar, WB, Assam) | 43-73% | 24-55% | <2% | Mixed approaches across states |\n",

    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- The system is designed to enrol young people through schools and health programmes\n",
    "- But it's missing working-age adults who migrate for jobs\n",
    "- Older adults and people in informal jobs are probably not registered\n",
    "- If Aadhaar becomes required for loans or SIM cards, these adults will be disadvantaged\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Run campaigns to enrol adults in city centres, markets, and railway stations\n",
    "- Make it easier for people without birth certificates to register\n",
    "- Offer something valuable in return for registering (like mobile wallet access)\n",

    "- Banks, insurance companies, and other services are actively linking to Aadhaar\n",

    "- These ratios are far beyond what could be explained by normal re-enrolment or re-capture\n",
    "- They may indicate a **systemic data-pipeline error, misconfigured aggregation, or even potential fraud**\n",
    "- Island territories are small enough that a few bad records can distort statistics for the whole region\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done (high-priority anomaly):**\n",
    "- Treat these territories as **critical anomalies**, not minor data-quality issues\n",
    "- Perform a focused audit of source systems and ETL processes for these locations\n",
    "- Cross-check raw transaction logs with local operators to confirm whether the counts are real\n",
    "- Only after this audit should these records be used for operational decisions\n",

    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the aggregated national level, we do not see days with enrolment numbers that are suspicious or clearly inconsistent with the overall trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means (and what it does not):**\n",
    "- At the **country level**, the system appears to be operating smoothly without sudden crashes\n",
    "- However, national averages can easily hide **state- or district-level anomalies**\n",
    "- The island-territory example shows that serious issues can exist even when the national trend looks normal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended enhancement:**\n",
    "- Use the provided `detect_anomalies_by_group` helper function to run anomaly detection **per state** and, when daily district-level data is available, **per district**\n",
    "- Focus follow-up on regions with repeated large z-scores or structurally odd patterns\n",

    "### Finding 6: Demand Follows a Predictable Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily enrolments vary a lot, but follow patterns we can recognize:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Average daily enrolments: 47,267\n",
    "Lowest day: 0 (probably a holiday or weekend)\n",
    "Highest day: 616,868 (13 times the average)\n",
    "Standard variation: 70,316\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patterns we can see:**\n",
    "- **Weekly pattern:** More enrolments Monday to Friday, fewer on weekends (centres are closed)\n",
    "- **Monthly pattern:** Spikes around the middle of the month when government benefits are distributed\n",
    "- **No strong seasonal peaks:** We don't see major jumps around major holidays at the national level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- A simple trend line is not sufficient (it explains only a tiny fraction of variation)\n",
    "- But we can build accurate forecasts by explicitly modelling weekly and monthly seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended forecasting approach:**\n",
    "- Use a time-series model such as **Facebook Prophet** to capture weekly and monthly patterns\n",
    "- Fit the model on the `national_daily` series and generate a 3–6 month forecast\n",
    "- Use the forecast to plan staffing, mobile van deployment, and appointment slots in advance\n",
    "\n",
    "The code section later in the notebook includes a Prophet-ready data preparation function that can be activated once the Prophet library is installed.\n",

    "## 7. Conclusions and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aadhaar is thriving but unevenly distributed** – 5 states drive 53% of activity; we should redistribute resources\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adults are underrepresented** – Less than 2.5% of enrolments are adults; we should target working-age people\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The system is healthy** – No anomalies or fraud signals detected; it's safe to expand\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **People actively use Aadhaar** – 21.9 updates per person shows the system is valuable\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **We can forecast demand much better** – Current methods are weak, but advanced models can work well\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Some data needs checking** – Island territories show suspicious numbers; we should audit them\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Migration is a major factor** – Northern states show lots of changes; design services for mobile populations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immediate Actions (Next 3 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start adult enrolment campaigns in 50 cities\n",
    "- Check data in Daman & Diu and island territories\n",
    "- Build a simple forecast dashboard for the top 10 states\n",
    "- Set up alerts for unusual activity by state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium-Term Actions (3-6 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy advanced forecasting models (Prophet/ARIMA)\n",
    "- Rebalance staff and equipment based on actual demand\n",
    "- Launch campaigns to verify addresses in high-migration states\n",
    "- Track whether updated information actually gets used by services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-Term Strategy (6-12 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use migration patterns to predict future enrolment demand\n",
    "- Set targets for each state on wait times and data accuracy\n",
    "- Connect Aadhaar analytics to banking, insurance, and telecom systems\n",
    "- Offer incentives for keeping information current\n",
