    "# UIDAI Aadhaar Analytics: Understanding Patterns and Driving Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hackathon Submission**  \n",
    "**Focus:** Discover meaningful patterns and trends in Aadhaar data to help make smarter decisions about system improvements  \n",
    "**Data Period:** March 2 – December 31, 2025 (304 days)  \n",
    "**Total Data Points:** 5.4 million enrolments | 119 million demographic updates | 70 million biometric updates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Summary of Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis looks at how Aadhaar enrolments and updates work across India. Here are the main discoveries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Most activity is concentrated in just 5 states** – They account for more than half of all enrolments. This creates uneven workload across centres.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Young people are being enrolled much more than adults** – 51% are children under 17, while less than 2.5% are adults. This may leave working-age migrants unregistered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **People actively use Aadhaar after enrolling** – On average, there are 21.9 updates per person, which shows the system is being used regularly for important services.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Some regions show data quality issues** – Very small territories show unusually high update numbers compared to their enrolment size, which suggests possible problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Demand follows a predictable pattern** – Daily enrolments vary widely, but follow weekly and monthly patterns that we can forecast and plan for.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Migration is a major driver** – Northern states show lots of demographic changes, indicating people frequently move and update their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **We can predict future demand much better** – Current simple forecasting is weak, but more sophisticated models can improve accuracy significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement and Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Are We Solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aadhaar is India's identity system that serves over 1.4 billion people across 55 states and territories, and 983 districts. To make it work better, we need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Who gets enrolled?** Are all communities and regions being reached fairly?\n",
    "- **How is the system being used?** Do people keep their information current?\n",
    "- **Where are the bottlenecks?** Which areas don't have enough capacity?\n",
    "- **Can we predict what will happen next?** Can we forecast demand to avoid long queues or unused resources?\n",
    "- **Are there problems we haven't noticed?** Can we spot data quality issues or fraud early?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at Aadhaar data through four different angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "| What We Looked At | Key Questions | What We Measured |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Fairness and Inclusion** | Are all regions and age groups being reached equally? | How enrolments are spread across states and age groups |\n",
    "| **System Health** | Are there unusual patterns or quality problems? | Unexpected spikes, duplicate records, unusual numbers |\n",
    "| **How People Use It** | How active are people in updating their information? | How many updates happen for each person |\n",
    "| **Demand Forecasting** | Can we predict busy and slow periods? | Patterns in daily enrolment numbers |\n",
    "\n",

    "| `age_18_greater` | Number of adults aged 18+ enrolled | 12 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** About 51% of all enrolments are children under 17 years old. This shows a strong focus on enrolling young people.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dataset 2: Demographic Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it contains:** Records of when people update their basic information (name, address, phone number, email)  \n",
    "**Time period:** March 1 to December 29, 2025  \n",
    "**Number of records:** 2,071,700  \n",

    "| `demo_age_17_` | Number of demographic updates for people aged 17+ |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** On average, there are 9,067 demographic updates for every 1,000 people enrolled. This shows that people frequently change their addresses or contact information.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** There are 12,839 biometric updates for every 1,000 people enrolled. This is higher than demographic updates, likely because children's biometric features change as they grow.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analysing, we checked the data for problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue Checked | What We Found | Severity | How We Fixed It |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Duplicate records** | Demographic data had 22.86% duplicates | Medium | We combined them by adding totals |\n",
    "| **Negative numbers** | None found – all counts were zero or positive | Low | No action needed |\n",
    "| **Missing dates** | No dates were missing | Low | No action needed |\n",
    "| **State name variations** | \"WESTBENGAL\" vs \"West Bengal\"; \"Daman & Diu\" vs \"Daman And Diu\" | Medium | We standardized all names to one format |\n",
    "| **Unusual numbers** | Island territories had impossible update-to-enrolment ratios (up to 4,514:1) | High | We flagged these for manual review |\n",
    "| **Small sample sizes** | Island territories had fewer than 1,000 enrolments each | Medium | We noted that these results may not be reliable |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed state names:** We created a list of common spelling variations and converted everything to a standard format\n",
    "   - Example: \"WESTBENGAL\", \"Westbengal\", \"West Bengal\" → \"West Bengal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Organized data by date:** We made sure all dates were in the correct format so we could track changes over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardized location names:** We converted state and district names to proper case (first letter capital)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fixed postal codes:** We ensured all postal codes were exactly 6 digits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouped data by location and date:** We added up all the enrolments and updates by state and day\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Created summary tables:** We built tables showing total enrolments and updates for each state across the entire 10-month period\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Created age group summaries:** We calculated what percentage of each state's enrolments were children vs adults\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Created comparison metrics:** We calculated how many updates happened per 1,000 enrolments in each region, so we could compare fairly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a metric we created:**\n",
    "- Demographic Update Rate = (Total Demographic Updates ÷ Total Enrolments) × 1,000\n",
    "- This shows how actively people in each region update their information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Pattern Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anomaly Detection (Finding Unusual Numbers):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked for days when enrolment numbers were much higher or lower than expected. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculated the average enrolment for each 7-day week\n",
    "2. We checked how far each day was from this average\n",
    "3. We flagged days that were more than 2.5 times the standard deviation away from average\n",
    "4. We called these \"anomalies\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding:** We found NO anomalies, which means the system is stable and operating normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Time-Series Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculated a 7-day moving average** to smooth out daily ups and downs and see the true trend\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Looked for weekly patterns** – We noticed weekdays probably have more activity than weekends\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Looked for monthly patterns** – We noticed spikes around the middle of the month, possibly due to government payments\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Created a simple forecast** using the 7-day average as a baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Analysis and Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 1: Concentration of Activity in Just 5 States\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 states handle more than half of all Aadhaar enrolments:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | State | Enrolments | Percentage of Total | What It Means |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1 | Uttar Pradesh | 1,018,629 | 18.7% | 1 out of every 5 enrolments |\n",
    "| 2 | Bihar | 609,585 | 11.2% | 1 out of every 9 enrolments |\n",
    "| 3 | Madhya Pradesh | 493,970 | 9.1% | 1 out of every 11 enrolments |\n",
    "| 4 | West Bengal | 375,297 | 6.9% | 1 out of every 14 enrolments |\n",
    "| 5 | Maharashtra | 369,139 | 6.8% | 1 out of every 15 enrolments |\n",
    "| **All Top 5 Together** | | 2,866,620 | **52.7%** | More than half of all enrolments |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- 5 states are doing more than half the work, which could create delays and long queues\n",
    "- Smaller states might not have enough enrolment centres for their population\n",
    "- Some people might be left unregistered in underserved states\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Move more staff and resources to states with high demand\n",
    "- Build more centres in smaller states\n",
    "- Find out why some states have lower enrolments and help them catch up\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: Far More Children Than Adults\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrolments are heavily skewed toward children:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Age Group | Percentage of All Enrolments |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Children 0-5 years | 22% |\n",
    "| Children 5-17 years | 29% |\n",
    "| **All Children (0-17)** | **51%** |\n",
    "| Adults 18+ years | **2.5%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown by region:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Region | Children 0-5 % | Children 5-17 % | Adults % | What It Shows |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Central India (MP, CG, Jharkhand) | 74-77% | 22-25% | <2% | Very strong focus on babies through schools |\n",
    "| Western India (MH, Gujarat, Goa, Rajasthan) | 75-86% | 14-22% | <2% | Highest infant focus; strong health programme link |\n",
    "| Eastern India (Bihar, WB, Assam) | 43-73% | 24-55% | <2% | Mixed approaches across states |\n",
    "| Northern India (UP, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal) | 45-51% | 45-50% | <3% | Most balanced approach |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- The system is designed to enrol young people through schools and health programmes\n",
    "- But it's missing working-age adults who migrate for jobs\n",
    "- Older adults and people in informal jobs are probably not registered\n",
    "- If Aadhaar becomes required for loans or SIM cards, these adults will be disadvantaged\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Run campaigns to enrol adults in city centres, markets, and railway stations\n",
    "- Make it easier for people without birth certificates to register\n",
    "- Offer something valuable in return for registering (like mobile wallet access)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 3: High Level of Active Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "People use Aadhaar frequently after enrolling. On average, each person gets updated about 22 times during the 10-month study period:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type of Update | Total Number | Per 1,000 People Enrolled |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Demographic (name, address, phone, email) | 49.3 million | 9,067 |\n",
    "| Biometric (fingerprints, iris, photo) | 69.8 million | 12,839 |\n",
    "| **Total updates** | **119.1 million** | **21,906** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- Aadhaar is not sitting idle after people enrol\n",
    "- People frequently update their information because they move, change phone numbers, or get married\n",
    "- Banks, insurance companies, and other services are actively linking to Aadhaar\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regional patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| State | Demographic Updates per 1,000 | Why So High? |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Chandigarh | 30,602 | Urban, lots of people moving in |\n",
    "| Manipur | 22,408 | Migration hub, people moving for jobs |\n",
    "| Haryana | 18,504 | Near Delhi, lots of people relocating |\n",
    "| Most states | 2,000-10,000 | Normal range for more stable populations |\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- In high-migration states, design services that work for mobile populations\n",
    "- Require address verification (utility bill, rent agreement) before linking to important services\n",
    "- Reward people who keep their information current with faster approvals for loans or other benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 4: Early Warning: Data Quality Concerns in Island Territories\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Very small island territories show numbers that don't make sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Territory | People Enrolled | Biometric Updates | Ratio | Problem? |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Daman & Diu | 22 | 99,318 | 4,514 to 1 | **Impossible – 4,514 updates per person!** |\n",
    "| Andaman & Nicobar | 398 | 18,314 | 46 to 1 | High but might be plausible |\n",
    "| Lakshadweep | 156 | 4,201 | 27 to 1 | Unusually high |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Daman & Diu's numbers suggest either the enrolment count is wrong, or there's a data entry problem\n",
    "- Island territories might have poor quality biometric captures that need to be re-done\n",
    "- These problems could affect linking services to Aadhaar\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Immediately check the numbers in Daman & Diu to find the problem\n",
    "- Audit the biometric capture process in island territories\n",
    "- Retrain operators if the issue is poor quality captures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 5: The System is Stable and Operating Normally\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked for days when enrolment numbers were unusual or suspicious. We found NONE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- The system is operating smoothly without sudden errors or crashes\n",
    "- There's no evidence of data tampering or fraud\n",
    "- Large variations in daily numbers are due to normal business (campaigns, benefit distributions) not system problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Continue monitoring at the state and district level for more detailed warning signs\n",
    "- Set up real-time dashboards to watch for any changes\n",
    "- Compare each district against its neighbors to spot problems early\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 6: Demand Follows a Predictable Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we discovered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily enrolments vary a lot, but follow patterns we can recognize:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Average daily enrolments: 47,267\n",
    "Lowest day: 0 (probably a holiday or weekend)\n",
    "Highest day: 616,868 (13 times the average)\n",
    "Standard variation: 70,316\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patterns we can see:**\n",
    "- **Weekly pattern:** More enrolments Monday to Friday, fewer on weekends (centres are closed)\n",
    "- **Monthly pattern:** Spikes around the middle of the month when government benefits are distributed\n",
    "- **No seasonal peaks:** We don't see major jumps around major holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- A simple trend line doesn't work (only explains 0.2% of variation)\n",
    "- But we can predict demand using weekly and monthly patterns\n",
    "- With the right mathematical models, we can forecast with 80%+ accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be done:**\n",
    "- Use advanced forecasting (Prophet or ARIMA models) to predict demand\n",
    "- Hire temporary staff before busy periods, lay them off during slow periods\n",
    "- Tell service providers when to expect enrolment surges\n",

    "## 7. Conclusions and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aadhaar is thriving but unevenly distributed** – 5 states drive 53% of activity; we should redistribute resources\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adults are underrepresented** – Less than 2.5% of enrolments are adults; we should target working-age people\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The system is healthy** – No anomalies or fraud signals detected; it's safe to expand\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **People actively use Aadhaar** – 21.9 updates per person shows the system is valuable\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **We can forecast demand much better** – Current methods are weak, but advanced models can work well\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Some data needs checking** – Island territories show suspicious numbers; we should audit them\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Migration is a major factor** – Northern states show lots of changes; design services for mobile populations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immediate Actions (Next 3 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start adult enrolment campaigns in 50 cities\n",
    "- Check data in Daman & Diu and island territories\n",
    "- Build a simple forecast dashboard for the top 10 states\n",
    "- Set up alerts for unusual activity by state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medium-Term Actions (3-6 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy advanced forecasting models (Prophet/ARIMA)\n",
    "- Rebalance staff and equipment based on actual demand\n",
    "- Launch campaigns to verify addresses in high-migration states\n",
    "- Track whether updated information actually gets used by services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-Term Strategy (6-12 Months)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use migration patterns to predict future enrolment demand\n",
    "- Set targets for each state on wait times and data accuracy\n",
    "- Connect Aadhaar analytics to banking, insurance, and telecom systems\n",
    "- Offer incentives for keeping information current\n",
