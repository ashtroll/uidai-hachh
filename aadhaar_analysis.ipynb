    "                \"- States such as _State C_ exhibit a **higher share of child enrolments** (0–5 and 5–17), indicating either recent expansion of coverage among children or integration of Aadhaar enrolment with school/ICDS systems.\",\n",

    "                \"- Biometric update intensity is particularly high in _State F_, potentially reflecting either a young population profile or initial capture quality issues.\",\n",

    "## 3. Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology is organised into distinct stages, making the analysis reproducible and extensible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion and Schema Harmonisation**\n",
    "   - Read all CSV partitions for each dataset and vertically concatenate them.\n",
    "   - Parse `date` into a proper datetime field.\n",
    "   - Ensure consistent casing and trimming of `state`, `district`, and datatypes for `pincode`.\n",
    "   - Retain a common key: `(date, state, district, pincode)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Quality Checks**\n",
    "   - Check for missing, invalid, or duplicate keys.\n",
    "   - Validate non-negativity and reasonableness of counts.\n",
    "   - Identify potential data-entry anomalies (e.g., very large counts on a single day at a single pincode).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering and Derived Metrics**\n",
    "   - Aggregate data to multiple levels: pincode, district, state, and national.\n",
    "   - Compute age-wise proportions and totals:\n",
    "     - Enrolment profile: child vs adult share by state.\n",
    "     - Update profile: ratio of demographic to biometric updates by age group.\n",
    "   - Derive **intensity metrics**, e.g., updates per 1,000 enrolments (proxy, since individual-level link is absent).\n",
    "   - Construct **time-series indicators**: 7-day rolling averages, seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualisation**\n",
    "   - Time series of daily enrolments and updates at national and state levels.\n",
    "   - State-wise rankings and distributions of enrolment and update intensities.\n",
    "   - Age-group patterns across states and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Anomaly Detection and Risk Indicators**\n",
    "   - Spot unusually high spikes in enrolment or updates using z-score based methods on residuals.\n",
    "   - Compute anomaly indicators at pincode/state level and examine their geographical and temporal clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Predictive / Forward-Looking Indicators (Lightweight Models)**\n",

    "This final section is meant to be **directly used in the PDF report**. After running the notebook and inspecting the actual figures, you can fill in specific numbers and state names. Below is a suggested structure and example language you can adapt based on the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.1 Key Patterns and Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enrolment Intensity and Age Structure**\n",
    "- Certain states (e.g., _State A, State B_) account for the largest share of total Aadhaar enrolments in the sample period.\n",
    "- States such as _State C_ exhibit a **higher share of child enrolments** (0–5 and 5–17), indicating either recent expansion of coverage among children or integration of Aadhaar enrolment with school/ICDS systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Behaviour and Lifecycle**\n",
    "- Demographic updates per 1,000 enrolments are highest in _State D_ and _State E_, consistent with higher migration and mobile number churn.\n",
    "- Biometric update intensity is particularly high in _State F_, potentially reflecting either a young population profile or initial capture quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Dynamics and Campaign Effects**\n",
    "- The national time series reveals **distinct peaks in enrolment and updates** around [dates/events], which likely correspond to targeted campaigns or scheme deadlines.\n",
    "- Outside these peaks, there is a relatively stable baseline, suggesting predictable workload for centres.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomalies and Risk Indicators**\n",
    "- Z-score based anomaly detection flags **unusually high spikes** in enrolment on [dates] in [states/districts].\n",
    "- Some states show **consistently elevated anomaly rates**, which may warrant further audit of centre-level behaviour and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.2 Proposed Solution Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inclusion and Outreach Targeting Framework**\n",
    "- Use **age-profile and enrolment intensity** indicators to select states/districts where child or adult coverage appears relatively low.\n",
    "- Launch targeted campaigns:\n",
    "  - **School-based drives** in regions with low 5–17 enrolment.\n",
    "  - **Women-focused drives** leveraging SHGs, Anganwadi centres, and health facilities if gender-disaggregated data is integrated later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capacity Planning and Resource Allocation Framework**\n",
    "- Use **state- and district-level demand forecasts** to adjust:\n",
    "  - Number of enrolment/update kits and staff per centre.\n",
    "  - Centre operating hours and appointment scheduling.\n",
    "- Prioritise extra capacity in locations with both high predicted demand and high update-to-enrolment ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk-Based Supervision and Quality Assurance Framework**\n",
    "- Maintain an **anomaly score** for each state and (if data is available) each enrolment centre/operator.\n",
    "- For high-risk entities, apply:\n",
    "  - Additional checks on documentation or biometrics.\n",
    "  - Targeted refresher training on capture quality.\n",
    "  - Periodic audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dashboard and Monitoring Framework**\n",
    "- Build a multi-level dashboard (national/state/district) with core KPIs:\n",
    "  - Total enrolments and age-wise shares.\n",
    "  - Demographic and biometric update intensities.\n",
    "  - Anomaly rates and recent flagged events.\n",
    "  - Short-term demand forecasts.\n",
    "- Integrate simple decision rules (e.g., thresholds for alerts) to make the analytics immediately actionable.\n",
